docker run --name SUPERGROK -itd jpetazzo/supergrok

docker logs SUPERGROK

Starting NGINX.
Starting ngrok.
Waiting for tunnel URL...

Your supergrok tunnelizer is available at: http://47eb4c85.ngrok.io

If you go to that URL, you should see the default "Welcome to NGINX!" page.
To connect to one of your Docker nodes, add the IP address of that node (and
an optional port number) after that URL. For instance, to reach the service
running on node 10.0.3.5 and exposed on port 8000, just go to the following
address: http://xxxx.ngrok.io/10.0.3.5:8000 

Here is the URL in a machine-catchable format (so you can grep ^URL= these
messages, if you are so inclined):

URL=http://47eb4c85.ngrok.io

Note that NGINX will not rewrite absolute links contained in your pages. In
other words, if you serve a web page containing a link to "/hello", it will
translate to http://xxxx.ngrok.io/hello, which will not work. The correct
link would be http://xxxx.ngrok.io/10.0.3.5:8000/hello! However, NGINX will
rewrite "Location:" headers, so simple HTTP redirections should work. If it
is a problem for you, you can run a dedicated ngrok tunnel for your service
with the following command (assuming you want to expose the service running
on node 10.0.3.5 and exposed on port 8000):
docker run --net host -ti jpetazzo/ngrok http 10.0.3.5:8000

Have fun!
